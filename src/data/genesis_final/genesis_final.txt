The CSV file has been signed by the following key

| Unique ID                              | Fingerprint                                        |

You can import the public keys from the keyserver network:

```
gpg --recv-keys 30C4B91C7A85D234
```

Once you have already imported the public keys, check
the signature of the file `genesis_final.csv`

```
gpg --verify genesis_final.csv.asc genesis_final.csv
```

Note: you should never use a GnuPG version you just downloaded to check the integrity of the source — use an existing, trusted GnuPG installation, e.g., the one provided by your distribution.

If the output of the above command is similar to the following, then either you don't have our public keys or the signature was generated by someone else and the file should be treated suspiciously.

```
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
```

If you instead see:

```
gpg: Good signature from "ian yang <ian@nervos.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 0D87 1C39 8C18 2304 C46C  4536 30C4 B91C 7A85 D234
```

then you have a copy of our keys and the signatures are valid, but either you have not marked the keys as trusted or the keys are a forgery. In this case, at the very least, you should compare the fingerprints that are shown above.

Ideally, you'll see something like:

```
gpg: Signature made Sat Nov  9 10:51:34 2019 CST
gpg:                using RSA key 0D871C398C182304C46C453630C4B91C7A85D234
gpg:                issuer "ian@nervos.org"
gpg: Good signature from "ian yang <ian@nervos.org>" [ultimate]
```
